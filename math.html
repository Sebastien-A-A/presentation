        I was in grade 5, the teacher entered the class one day and said that there is a new competition called "La Course Aux Nombres", basically it's a test of 30 questions, and you have 7 minutes to complete it. The majority of the questions need mental calculus since calculators are not allowed, and the rest of the questions include geometry with some algebra.

        I was really excited and I started training every single day. Dad helped me to bring me some tests for my training. After many test at school, my scores were the highest so they choose me to represent my grade in the final test against all the french speaking schools in Lebanon. After this great news, I kept pushing myself harder on the training. The last night before the final came, i decided to rest my brain, so I slept early.

        The big day came, all the finalists and I, met at a french school, we entered a class, took our pens out, and the countdown started. While doing the test, I was stuck on a question, so after some thinking, I just skipped it and decided to come back to it later. So I rushed the other questions with full speed to save some time, I remember after I finished question number 30, I looked quickly on the clock, there was 14 seconds left, I moved directly to the last question, gave it some thinking, found the answer, and as I was finishing writing the answer, I heard "Pens down everyone". So the results were anounced after 2 weeks in a ceremony that I attended, so they claimed that I was classed 1st and we knew that I got 30/30, definitely one of the best days of my life.

        So after this beautiful experience, I kept participating every year in this competition, I kept training hard and those are the results over the years:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>1st in Lebanon in grade 5</li>
        <li>2nd in Lebanon in grade 6</li>
        <li>4th in Lebanon in grade 7</li>
        <li>1st in Lebanon in grade 8</li>
        <li>2nd in Lebanon in grade 9</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In grade 10, the school had an interscholar math competition, it was a normal test of 90 minutes, but full of tricky questions. Long story short, I got the highest score, and after it, I went shopping since they offered me a gift card as a prize.üòÑ
